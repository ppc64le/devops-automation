# Oracle® Database as a Service

This folder contains examples on how Oracle Database on AIX can be delivered "as a service" in an environment where the core technology layer consists of IBM Power systems and storage managed by IBM Power Virtualization Center (PowerVC).

It is assumed that you have access to Oracle database software on IBM AIX to be able to build the PowerVC images used in the examples.

The illustrated concepts can be adopted to other database and/or operating system offerings.

# devops-automation
This repository contains several example automation scripts for DevOps on Power Systems, which provide working automation samples that demonstrate how to provision cloud infrastructure and optionally install sample applications atop that infrastructure.

Examples of such content includes Terraform automation as well as Ansible playbooks that are useful across hybrid multicloud estates.

Please reach out to Joe Cropper (jwcroppe@us.ibm.com) with any questions, comments or suggestions!
